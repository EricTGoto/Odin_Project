<h2>Positioning</h2>

<b>Static positioning</b>: default position of every element

<b>Relative positioning</b>: 

* same as static but properties top,right,bottom,left affect the position
* element does not affect the positions of other elements
* "relative to itself"

<b>Absolute positioning</b>:

* allows you to position something at an exact point on the screen without disturbing other elements around it, removed from document flow
* position will be relative to the next parent element with relative/absolute positioning

<b>Fixed positioning</b>:  puts an element relative to the viewport, if page is scrolled, element will stay in the same spot on the screen, e.g. a floating chat button

<b>Sticky positioning</b>: makes elements act like normal elements until scrolled past, then they behave like a fixed element
