This is a diary of my progress through the Odin Project.
This will contain notes and random thoughts I've had as I work through the curriculum.

Dec 28th.
Began Odin Project.

HTML boilerplate: 
<!DOCTYPE html> - specifies version of HTML

<html>
    <head> -place where we put important metadata
        <title> </title> -gives browser tab a name
        <meta charset="utf-8"> -encoding of page
    </head>

    <body> -where the text of the webpage is added
    </body>
</html>

CSS lets you style HTML, add rules to selectors and HTML elements that are selected will follow those CSS rules.
example: 
the following makes all div text purple
div {
    color: puple;
}

. is the universal selector i.e. . { }
.___ is the class selector i.e. .text
#___ is the ID selector i.e. #pancake_section

More specific CSS rules take precedence.
ID > Class > Type
If tie, whichever rule was specified last is the winner.
